                By the 8th century, cannabis had been introduced by Arab traders to Central and Southern Africa, where it is known as "dagga"[145] and many Rastas say it is a part of their African culture that they are reclaiming.[146] It is sometimes also referred to as "the healing of the nation", a phrase adapted from Revelation 22:2.[147] There are various methods of transmission that might explain how cannabis smoking came to be part of Rastafari.
